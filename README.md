Project Huǒ tǔ shuǐ (fire earth water)
It is a game wherein it will test your luck to defeat your opponents
Our project features have improved since the main user has endless life until itreaches to the point where he/she loses all hp.
You will battle a randomizer where in you have 3 lives to survive the game
The game is played with three possible elements that represent earth, water, and fire. The earth representing ( 土 ); water is( 水 ), fire with ( 火 )
During the Battle, you will choose which element you will pick to attack the enemy. earth beats water, water beats fire and fire beats earth. every time you lose to the opponent you will lose a life. a total of 3 losses will result to game over
We will apply OOP in this project based on what we have learned in our previous lessons. One key feature that we will be using in our project is "class and objects".
